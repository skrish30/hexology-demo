I saw UFO once I was a SO 9 playing in the street with a friend who's a couple of years older .and we saw a featureless silver disk hovering over the houses we watched it for a few seconds and it shocked away incredibly quickly even as a kid I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics .we went inside to tell the grown ups and they were skeptical you'd be skeptical to rise .I got my own back a few years later one of those grown ups told me last night I saw a flying saucer I was coming out of the pub after a few drinks I stopped in NASA can explain onsite .psychologists have shown we contrast our brains to tell the truth it's easy to fool ourselves I saw something but what's more likely that I saw an alien spacecraft or that my brain misinterpreted the data my eyes were getting it .ever since I've wondered why don't we see flying sources floating around at the very least why don't we see life out there in the cosmos it's a puzzle and I've discussed it with dozens of experts from different disciplines of the past 3 decades and is no consensus from Drake began searching for 18 signals back in 1960 so far nothing and with each passing year this non observation this lack of evidence for any AV activity gets more puzzling because we should see them should weigh .
