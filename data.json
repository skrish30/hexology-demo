      "text": "I saw UFO once I was a SO 9 playing in the street with a friend who's a couple of years older .and we saw a featureless silver disk hovering over the houses we watched it for a few seconds and it shocked away incredibly quickly even as a kid I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics .we went inside to tell the grown ups and they were skeptical you'd be skeptical to rise .I got my own back a few years later one of those grown ups told me last night I saw a flying saucer I was coming out of the pub after a few drinks I stopped in NASA can explain onsite .psychologists have shown we contrast our brains to tell the truth it's easy to fool ourselves I saw something but what's more likely that I saw an alien spacecraft or that my brain misinterpreted the data my eyes were getting it .ever since I've wondered why don't we see flying sources floating around at the very least why don't we see life out there in the cosmos it's a puzzle and I've discussed it with dozens of experts from different disciplines of the past 3 decades and is no consensus from Drake began searching for 18 signals back in 1960 so far nothing and with each passing year this non observation this lack of evidence for any AV activity gets more puzzling because we should see them should weigh .the universe is 13.8000000000 years old give or take if we represent the age of the universe by one year then our species came into being about 12 minutes before midnight 30 December 1 .western civilization has existed for a few seconds extraterrestrial civilizations could have started in the summer months .imagine a sum of civilization developing a level of technology more advanced than ours the tech based on a accepted physics done talking one holds a wall drives one after .just an extrapolation of the sort of tech that Ted celebrates not civilization could program self replicating problems to visit every planetary system in the galaxy if they launched the first problems just after midnight one always stay .thank you for breakfast same day they could have colonized the galaxy .into the light the colonization is much more difficult it just takes longer a civilization from anyone of millions of galaxies could have called heist I'm gonna see .seems far fetched maybe it is but .wouldn't aliens engage in some recognizable activity world let's around the start to capture free some lights collaborates on a wikipedia Galactica watches chopped down to the you know this way here .so where is everybody it's also because we do expect these civilizations to exist after all it could be 1000000000000 planets in the galaxy maybe more .you don't need any special knowledge to consider this question on ice exploded with lots of people over the years and I find they often frame that thinking in terms of the battery is that what needs to be cleared of planets is to host a communicative civilizations .and they usually identified 4 key bindings habitability that's the first part we need a terrestrial planets in not just lights Goldilocks zone where water flows is a liquid they run that in 2016 astronomers concerned there's a planet in the habitable zone is the closest stop proxima Centauri right so close the breakthrough starship project plans to send probes that we become a star faring species .but not all well to have a total sum will be too close to the stock price will be too far away and the fleas .abiogenesis the creation of life from non life that's a second .",
