### 13th May

So far the team has been working independently to do their own research, and they meet up soon to discuss what they have learnt and built. The workload has been split into two parts: 1. Webpage development 2. Work with IBM Discovery. Required skills like JavaScript are learnt based on different jobs. Several initial tutorials shared on the IBM Trello board have completed.

### 28th May

The team has successfully used Watson Discovery to extract concepts and keywords from a transcript of a TED Talk Video. Screenshots of the JSON Data output were shared with client using Skype.

To produce real-time interactions with Watson from a video source whilst the video is playing, is regarded as the future next plan.

To emulate the idea that Watson will analyse content and share information to the user in real-time, as if the user were at an event listening to a Keynote Speaker, it is agreed that the team will download the Ted Talk reference video to a server and stream it to Watson.

Streaming video gives Watson instant access to the video content at any point in the timeline whilst the video is playing. This in turn, enables the prototype to simulate the user experience of gathering information curated by Watson in Real-time whilst being at an event.

Downloading and streaming video from their own server gives the student team the chance to manage the media asset and deliver it to Watson in a controlled manor.

Furthermore, an investigation into the qualitative performance of real-time interactions with Watson will be tested by comparing a range of different outputs from Watson discovery, taken from different points in a transcript.

To be specific, the intention is to select a video transcript and Split it into a range of different lengths:

30 second in length from the start
60 seconds in length from the start
90 seconds in length from the start
120 seconds in length from the start

A comparison of these different outputs will give an insight into the way Watson understands narrative and how it unfolds over time.

In this respect, we anticipate that the outcome of this experiment will enable us to validate whether a real-time outputs produce an engaging user experience.

To facilitate this experiment and also for general use in the building of the prototype, hexology will select 4 to 6 videos from the Ted Website for the team to use as a resource.

#### Next steps:

It is agreed that the student team will develop the parts of the prototype that:

Download and store a Ted Talk Video to their server and stream it to Watson
Store the output from Watson Discovery, capturing video timecode

It is mutually understood that delivery of this functionality represents a key milestone in the development of the prototype, as it represents the part which captures and analyses content.

For the benefit of doubt, the remaining steps include:

how to personalise content Watson curates so that it is relevant to the user
how to display the content Watson curates

In addition is it possible to do a google search of any keywords or concepts?
Explore DBPedia which Watson seems to reference

#### Hexology will

Select sample videos from Ted Website and evaluate the output of these from Watson Discovery before our next meeting or Skype call.

The JSON output from Watson Discovery will be evaluated by Hexology to establish how to personalise the information Watson curates and will be discussed at our next meeting.

### June 10th
Meeting with both the client and academic supervisor to revamp the UI and prepare for the demonstration on 13th June
